            I am a software engineer driven by the pursuit of building efficient and impactful
            technology solutions.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            My passion for software development began in 2020, sparked by a deep curiosity about how systems operate and
            how code can be used to solve real-world problems.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Since then, I have developed a solid foundation in frontend and now will work on backend development too,
            contributing to various collaborative projects and technical initiatives that emphasize clean architecture,
            scalability, and innovation.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            My professional focus lies in creating modern, minimal, and high-performance applications that combine
            functionality with seamless user experience.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I am continuously evolving my technical expertise to build solutions that not only perform but also inspire
            confidence and progress.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <b>Technical Skills:</b> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, GitHub, and currently expanding expertise in Figma for
            UI/UX design and backend technologies.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <b>Value Proposition:</b> I bring precision, clean architecture, and a relentless focus on performance
            optimization. I design codebases that scale, maintain readability, and reflect strong problem-solving
            discipline. I prioritize clarity, maintainability, and efficiency in every line of code.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <b>Learning Commitment:</b> Starting from <b>October 25, 2025</b>, I have committed to a <b>1300-day coding
                journey</b> focused on mastering software development end-to-end — from learning syntax to applying
            design patterns, building production-grade systems, and refining real-world problem-solving skills. This
            disciplined path reflects my long-term vision of achieving technical mastery through consistency and
            execution.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <b>Vision Statement:</b> To build technology that empowers progress, simplifies complexity, and shapes a
            smarter, more connected future.

        <div class="text">
            <b>Current Focus:</b> Strengthening frontend architecture, expanding into backend systems, and developing
            production-ready full-stack applications that deliver measurable business value.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <b>Beyond Code:</b> When I'm not programming, I invest my time in the gym, reading technical and strategic
            literature, playing chess to enhance focus and logic, and staying curious about the future of software
            innovation.
